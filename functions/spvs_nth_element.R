  # spvs_nth_element <- function(vector, starting_position, n)
  # This function picks the nth element from a vector starting at the element at thestarting postion
  #
  #
  #   USAGE:
  #     vec <- spvs_nth_element(vector, starting_position, n)
  #
  #   INPUTS:
  #     vector = vector to pcik the elements from
  #     starting_position = element to start with
  #     n = step size
  #             
  #   OUTPUTS:
  #     vec     = vector with picked elements
